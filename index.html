      <p>
        I have been playing ice hockey from the age of 6 and have played for
        several different teams. The teams I have been playing for is: H√§sselby,
        Djurg√•rden, Modo, V√§ster√•s, Hv71 and Arboga. With alot of different
        teams, I've gotten a good knowledge about how to be productive in a
        group and also how to get along in a good way. I'm not shy of doing the
        hard work och take one for the team. Two important points for me is
        punctuality and always being positive, no matter the situation. I can
        speak/write both in Swedish and English.
